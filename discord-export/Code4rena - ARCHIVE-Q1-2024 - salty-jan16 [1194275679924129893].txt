Also noticed you wanted to do an audit with trail of bits. Is that one also already done and public?


[01/15/2024 21:27] escrow1337
Is this the exact same codebase that will be published on C4? I can see on rsvp that an extra 1k SLOC got added (this question also applies to the ToB audit). Thanks.

Codebase is the same, yes.  There was some discrepancy in the SLOC counting mechanic.  The final SLOC is 3,288 and the prize pool has been updated to $80k.

The issues in the Trail of Bits audit were remediated already.  Any issues with the remediation would still be valid of course.

For completeness the ABDK audit issues that were remediated are marked as Fixed in the audit while those that were not are marked as Info.  ABDK issues marked as Info are considered known for this audit.

I'm curious about "Custom error messages have been intentionally excluded, regardless of their potential gas savings." Could you share your reasoning?


[01/16/2024 22:15] danielcota
I’m more familiar with standard revert strings and didn’t want to refactor the entire project with custom error messages.


[01/16/2024 22:16] poeaudits
Having to flip the logic from positive to negative can be a pain. I get it.

Make sure you are cloning the repo and not just downloading the source.


[01/16/2024 23:27] mr_1x1
yes sure `git clone https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty`


[01/16/2024 23:31] danielcota
Should work fine. The necessary dependencies are normally downloaded as needed. Try upgrading forge.

Do we need sepolia's test tokens?


[01/17/2024 01:29] danielcota
For testing in Foundry?  You can just prank yourself as any address that already holds some.


[01/17/2024 04:31] spacecake8961
Love the project/code so far and pretty amazing ow far it came with limited resources 👍
I am trying to deploy locally a similar setup as is intended for Salty to be deployed on mainnet eventually.
I am trying to do that on a local fork of mainnet (using Anvil). I am looking for help around hoz the different parts are expected to be deployed. From my understanding of the code, I did these initia steps:
1. Deploy SALT token
2. Deploy Managed wallet
3. Deploy USDS stablecoin
4. Deploy ExchangeConfig

I thought I get your input on this before I go deeper into deploying everything (arbitrage, pools, staking, DAO, etc.)

Is the grantAccess function in the AccessManager only needed for the airdrop/bootstrapBallot logic? Can any address interact with the pools without needing approval of some kind?

Access is also needed to for staking SALT, depositing liquidity, depositing WBTC/WETH collateral and borrowing USDS.

Question about the `src/dev/Deployment.sol` file: How is it supposed to be ran?
I thought it was a FOundry Script so I ran the `initializeContracts` function as follows:
`forge script src/dev/Deployment.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --sig "initializeContracts()" -vvvv`
Not sure it is deploying the contracts on my local Anvil blockchain 🤔


[01/17/2024 06:45] danielcota
Deployment.sol is really just there for the unit tests.  If COVERAGE="no" the deployed contracts that are derived from this line are tested:

// The DAO contract can provide us with all other contract addresses in the protocol
    IDAO public dao = IDAO(address(0x112223db8E32d056170da32FD3Dba90adCa50159));


[01/17/2024 06:46] danielcota
COVERAGE=yes mostly unit tests using newly instantiated contracts so that the coverage works properly in Foundry - not the deployed ones.


[01/17/2024 06:49] danielcota
@spacecake8961 The Deployment.initializeContracts() function shows the order in which contracts are initialized - if you wanted to create a new deployment.

So    ``USDS   / SALT   / WETH   / WBTC   /  DAI  ``  are the only ERC20  tokens used    ( for this audit  )


[01/17/2024 10:24] aodkgkrogrogoovg2o3btivr
the arguments for   `` ManagedWallet  ``  constructor()  who are exactly ?


[01/17/2024 10:26] danielcota
Yes, those are the initial tokens.   The ManagedWallet is responsible for specifying the initialTeamWallet address.


[01/17/2024 10:52] aodkgkrogrogoovg2o3btivr
I see some privileged functions with onlyOwner on some contracts that says in comments that are executed at the deployment only once  (    ExchangeConfig::setContracts()   for example ), the DAO is the owner as i see too in another comment, so the DAO will execute them after the deployment or how exactly ? DAO will not make changes only after  the   proposal of changes ?


[01/17/2024 11:00] danielcota
Proposals are made via the Proposals.sol contract, are voted on and DAO.finalizeBallot(uint256 ballotID) is called to execute them - assuming that the votes are favorable and the voting period has passed.


[01/17/2024 11:03] aodkgkrogrogoovg2o3btivr
if you mentioned this, a ballot is a proposal ( someone who wants to make a modification and others can vote )  but its named a ballot for some reasons ?


[01/17/2024 11:04] danielcota
A proposal is a ballot that is voted on.

{Reactions}

[01/17/2024 11:05] aodkgkrogrogoovg2o3btivr
But what I wanted to ask is who is the ``onlyOwner``  of the ~Config  files ?   Because i see in the comments that   ``onlyOwner`` is the  DAO  but some of these  ``onlyOwner`` privileged functions says are executed at deployment but the DAO doesnt deploy those contracts to become the ``owner`` from ``onlyOwner``


[01/17/2024 11:06] danielcota
At deployment time the Deployer transfers them all to the DAO contract.

Initial liquidity of the bootstrap Ballot? 8 million SALT? Who eligible to receive it, the people who hold the xSalt tokens and provide liquidity(but how they can do  before the exchange is even launched.) or who can simply cast the vote in the Bootstrap Ballot. ? Don't understand it. 

`The initial bootstrapping rewards of 8 million SALT (for liquidity providers and xSALT holders) will be distributed at the default rate of 1% per day (initially 80k per day).`

I tried to deploy SaltRewards contract as follows but I am not sure if I deployed stakingRewardsEmitter, liquidityRewardsEmitter correctly, particuarly the last paramter with true/false part: 
```javascript
staking = new Staking(exchangeConfig, poolsConfig, stakingConfig);
        collateralAndLiquidity = new CollateralAndLiquidity(pools, exchangeConfig, poolsConfig, stakingConfig, stableConfig, priceAggregator, liquidizer); 
        stakingRewardsEmitter = new RewardsEmitter(staking, exchangeConfig, poolsConfig, rewardsConfig, true);
        collateralAndLiquidity = new CollateralAndLiquidity(pools, exchangeConfig, poolsConfig, stakingConfig, stableConfig, priceAggregator, liquidizer); 
        liquidityRewardsEmitter = new RewardsEmitter(collateralAndLiquidity, exchangeConfig, poolsConfig, rewardsConfig, false);
        saltRewards = new SaltRewards(stakingRewardsEmitter, liquidityRewardsEmitter, exchangeConfig, rewardsConfig);
```


[01/18/2024 04:19] danielcota
You'll want to reverse the true / false on two RewardsEmitter constructors.

what is the meaning of `zapping`


[01/18/2024 13:07] danielcota
That's how I feel! 😄


[01/18/2024 13:09] danielcota
Zapping means adding liquidity to the pool where the ratios of tokens being added are not the same as the ratio of the tokens in the pool.  Normally the ratios have to be the same, but zapping allows the ratios to be arbitrary.


[01/18/2024 13:09] thekmj
:thonk: the arb algorithm is interesting, have you considered going for golden section search


[01/18/2024 13:12] 0xprinc
i think that there occurs the arbitrage opportunity due to zapping. And then the arbitrage happens itself inside the protocol..


[01/18/2024 13:13] danielcota
Golden section search could be interesting.  At this point I don't think I'll modify the arbitrage search as it's already been through a couple audits and heavily tested, but I may experiment with the golden section variation for fun and see what happens.


[01/18/2024 13:14] danielcota
Arbitrage is a possibility with zapping as zapping automatically performs a swap to give the added tokens the correct ratio - and all swaps on the DEX are checked for arbitrage opportunities.

I am trying to setup my own deployment by copying the steps/code in comprehensive1.t.sol, but I can't seem to get the InitialDistribution contract to start with the required salt:

```
Error: The InitialDistribution contract should start with a SALT balance of 100 million SALT
  Error: a == b not satisfied [uint]
        Left: 0
       Right: 100000000000000000000000000
```
It seems this step should happen when finalizeBallot() is called in the BootstrapBallot.sol contract. Is there a step I may be missing?


[01/19/2024 03:23] guy_in0xnito
@Daniel Cota sir dm ed you


[01/19/2024 03:40] danielcota
You have to manually transfer the initial SALT supply to the InitialDistribution contract.

and is there any involvement of WETH when adding liquidity?

@Daniel Cota


[01/20/2024 08:27] danielcota
Liquidity is added for pairs of ERC20 tokens, yes.  WETH is involved only if it is one of the tokens referenced in a specific pool.

is fuzz test suit avaiable??


[01/20/2024 11:58] aripse
No, it doesn’t.


[01/20/2024 11:58] aripse
There is no connection to heritage here. What's happening is that when you `import` a file, it also brings in all the files that have already been imported in the parent file. Think of `import` as copying all the code from that file. So, when you `import` a file that itself contains `import` statements, it is equivalent to the following:

File0:
```
code_file0
```

File1:
```
import file0
code_file1
```

File2:
```
import file1
code_file2
```

After compilation, File2 becomes:
```
code_file0
code_file1
code_file2
```


[01/20/2024 12:03] aripse
That’s also why it is really important to use the syntax `import {Contract} from` : 
- to don’t waste time on compilation.
- to don’t use more gas on deployment (deploying contract you don’t use in your code but present in the file imported).
But for the last one, maybe the compiler is intelligent enough to remove unused contract, I’m not an expert in solidity compilation !

If any fellow auditor has gone through the arbitrage part

[01/20/2024 12:59] 0xphi
the loop iterates 8 times so that it finds the best bestArbAmountIn range from 1/128th to 125% of initial amountIn.

the algorithm uses _rightMoreProfitable which calculate amountOut 3 times based on the midpoint, which is basically simulating the three swaps of the given path.

since the path starts and ends with WETH, imo it's sufficient to use the difference between amoutOut and midpoint to see if there's any arb profit.

MIDPOINT_PRECISION serves as a tiny adjustment to see if right is even more profitable. If so, we assign left point with midpoint. If not, we assign right left point with midpoint. At the beginning of each loop, it always generate a new midpoint that is the midpoint of the new left and right point after the previous iteration. Thus the range keeps shrinking, which is why it's called bisection search.

It's only my interpretation and it might be wrong.

[01/21/2024 13:16] faithxia
Test function names need to start with the word `test`. The function you are attempting to match is not considered a test function at all, that's why its not working


[01/21/2024 13:16] faithxia
also, not sure if this is a requirement, but the test function might need to be `public`/`external` as well


[01/21/2024 13:16] 0xwizard
this is totally correct

How is the function `liquidateUser` in the file `CollateralAndLiquidity` called? Is it through some other contract? @Daniel Cota


[01/21/2024 15:00] faithxia
Supposed to be called by a liquidator, which can be an external user but more than likely is a liquidator bot written by someone to detect positions that become under-collateralized and liquidate them for $$$


[01/21/2024 15:03] sunosuporno
Yeah I was wondering same. I thought it would be called in upKeep in some way but apparently it isn't


[01/21/2024 15:04] faithxia
that wouldn't work, liquidation is an action, just like a swap or a trade or etc


[01/21/2024 15:04] faithxia
like it wouldn't make sense to do a swap in `upKeep()`, same idea with liquidation


[01/21/2024 15:05] sunosuporno
But internal swaps are being done in the upkeep function in `Liquidizer`. I thought would make sense to also look for under-collaterized positions there as well, and then liquidate, but I guess there is an issue of gas


[01/21/2024 15:07] faithxia
The internal swaps are not user swaps, liquidation is a user action. Note - I haven't yet really looked into any of this code, was just curious and taking a look today, but ye just talking about in general


[01/21/2024 15:08] faithxia
technically yes you can have it in the `performUpkeep()` flow but that will force users to pay gas for liquidations, as you said


[01/21/2024 15:08] faithxia
you can't automatically detect liquidatable users on chain without paying lots of gas (you have to check basically every user by calling `canUserBeLiquidated()`)


[01/21/2024 15:08] faithxia
its much easier to do that off-chain constantly (every block) and as soon as a liquidatable user is spotted, you can just call `liquidateUser()`

These are the initial whitelisted pairs:

SALT/WBTC
SALT/WETH
SALT/USDS

WBTC/USDS
WBTC/DAI
WBTC/WETH

WETH/USDS
WETH/DAI

USDS/DAI

what happens if the collateralandliquidity contract adds liquidity would the liquidity later be used for swapping? @Daniel Cota


[01/22/2024 11:15] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
or just add liq to the pool.sol contract?


[01/22/2024 11:18] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
and will it be a gradual addition of liquidity?


[01/22/2024 11:24] danielcota
WBTC/WETH liquidity used for collateral is swappable in the pools as well, yes.


[01/22/2024 11:25] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
roger that!


[01/22/2024 11:56] faithxia
yep, my point was that you can't check every user to find a liquidatable user on chain, using a node to query it off chain is the right way to do it and it's also why liquidation doesn't occur automatically

Hey there 👋
What is the suppsoed/suggested way of using the script in src/dev/Deployment.sol?
I have been trying to create a similar script but failling due to various issues, so now I want to use it directly.
Is it supposed to be executed on Sepolia network? I can see that it supposes the existence of some contracts already
And would you even recommen using it to get a local testing environment?

good morning,
in this function `_sendLiquidityRewards( uint256 liquidityRewardsAmount, uint256 directRewardsForSaltUSDS, bytes32[] memory poolIDs, uint256[] memory profitsForPools, uint256 totalProfits )`, are the `directRewardsForSaltUSDS` part of the `totalProfits`?


[01/23/2024 09:28] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
will it?


[01/23/2024 09:29] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
is there a kind of fixed numbers for them?


[01/23/2024 09:32] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
so there will always be a diff outcome


[01/23/2024 09:33] danielcota
The code favors the calculation with greater precision.


[01/23/2024 09:34] anmol.eth
Is the protocol only meant to support these pools?
1. whitelisted token : WBTC
2. whitelisted token : WETH
3. SALT:USDS
4. USDS:DAI
5. WBTC:WETH 

can't we have something like DAI:SALT or some other combinations of whitelisted tokens?


[01/23/2024 09:34] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
Hmmm okay


[01/23/2024 09:41] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
so rounding down is in the favor of this protocol?


[01/23/2024 10:03] infectedfuture
what is rounded down (addedLiquidity) is then used to calculate the amount of shares minted to the user: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty/blob/main/src/staking/Liquidity.sol#L102
So rounding this value down does favor the protocol

Is it expected a user to be able to burn his own USDS tokens, kind of weird behaviour? 😄


[01/23/2024 17:25] santiellena
I guess that's fine. It's for the user to keep his position above the minimum.


[01/23/2024 17:26] santiellena
And tokens are not actually being burned if you mean in the `CollateralAndLiquidity::repayUSDS` function

@Daniel Cota is there an invariant percentage for how much the Zap should charge the user? What's the limit?


[01/24/2024 11:28] danielcota
What do you mean by charge?


[01/24/2024 11:30] holydevoti0n
I noticed that when using the zap function, the user doesn't receive his total amount of liquidity back because `zapAmountA += pools.depositSwapWithdraw( tokenB, tokenA, swapAmountB, 0, block.timestamp );` is called and this calls the arbitrage that takes a fee for the DAO. After deducting this fee, the user should receive the total amount, right?


[01/24/2024 11:31] danielcota
Arbitrage happens after the swap is complete.  It doesn't affect the swap output returned to the user.

From the comment:

    // The percent of SALT Rewards that will be sent to the SALT/USDS pool.
    // This is done as SALT/USDS while an important pair for the exchange isn't involved in any arbitrage swap cycles (which would yield arbitrage profit for it as well as all pools which take part in arbitrage take a share of the profit).
    // This is because it isn't part of the usual token/WBTC and token/WETH structure - which allows other pools to be part of arbitrage swap cycles when other pools are traded.

Sir dmed you


[01/25/2024 04:08] faithxia
@zhaojie you can get a free Sepolia node from Alchemy. It will work much better than any public RPC nodes. Everyone should use a node provider for situations like this


[01/25/2024 04:09] faithxia
But yeah best case would be to run a local geth node, but then you'd need to wait for it to sync up first which is another small hurdle


[01/25/2024 04:10] zhaojie
okay thanks


[01/25/2024 04:15] faithxia
Just FYI, when you run a local node like this, it's still using the RPC node that you specify to fork off of


[01/25/2024 04:17] zhaojie
I gave up and I still use the remote sepolia node 😄


[01/25/2024 04:23] faithxia
Would you like some help? The steps to use Alchemy are roughly as follows:

1. Open an account / login with Google on Alchemy
2. Go to <https://dashboard.alchemy.com/apps> and press the blue "+ Create new app" button
3. Pick Ethereum Sepolia as your network (see screenshot)
4. Once you've created the App, you'll see an "API Key" button in the app dashboard. It has a link that you can use as the RPC url. Mine is `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/<SECRET_API_KEY_HERE>`. Just copy that and use it

So - as far as I understend, I can only work on whitelisted pools, correct? What will happen (flow?), when I call swap() with some unwhitelisted tokens? E.g. fee on transfer? I cannot navigate to the line of code which is responsible for checking if swapTokenIn or swapTokenOut is whitelisted


[01/27/2024 19:35] lsaudit
The same question here, in the deposit() - https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-salty/blob/53516c2cdfdfacb662cdea6417c52f23c94d5b5b/src/pools/Pools.sol#L205  what stops user from calling `deposit() ` with fee on transfer? I don't see any check for that


[01/27/2024 19:51] 0xciphky
If the pool isn't whitelisted they'll be no liquidity so the swap wouldn't work

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[01/27/2024 19:51] infectedfuture
only whitelisted pools have reserves, so only on these one can a swap happen

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[01/27/2024 19:53] infectedfuture
nothing, because `deposit()` just allow a user to send tokens to the pool which can then be used as `swapAmountIn` when calling `swap()`
If someone do not deposit before, they will have to call `depositSwapWithdraw`
its different from addingLiquidity to a pool which affect its reserves

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[01/27/2024 20:17] lsaudit
I can't see the whitelisting check in `addLiquidity()` either. What stops me from providing a liquidity to non-whitelisted token?

After swapping is the adjusted zapping amount meant to be equal?


[01/29/2024 06:14] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
anyone?


[01/29/2024 06:16] mylifechangefast.eth_70767
Or is the goal to ensure that when these adjusted amounts are used to add liquidity to the pool, the resulting ratio between the two tokens aligns with the existing ratio in the pool's reserves?


[01/29/2024 07:09] 0xauditism
the concept is to adjust to the same ratio of the pool. If the pool has 80% eth and 20% btc, and you put 5 eth and 5 btc, zapping will adjust the ratio for you

in the documentation it said that "provide Zero Fees on all swaps" but i dont see that mechanism in the project

you don't see it because there's no fees :D
If there was fees, you'll see some code to account for fees

Honestly it was a bit surprising for me to see some of the bugs found, which went unspotted by the ToB audit!
There's always a chance of a few leaked bugs but it felt like a couple of them were too obvious to be missed by such a reputed firm.

Grateful


[02/28/2024 21:02] forgebyola
6 unique highs and 31 meds is absolutely insane considering this had already gone through an audit. Goes to show the power of "decentralised" audits as I'll put it🔥🔥

Does the payout goes directly to metamask
Or do we have to do some import stuff out in metamask ?


[02/29/2024 12:39] guy_in0xnito
To the judges for this fast judging 
Thanks


[02/29/2024 13:16] kaveyjoe
Directly goes to wallet address  you provided on polygon Network.


[02/29/2024 16:56] guy_in0xnito
Didn't see any !


[02/29/2024 18:33] 0xauditism
they haven't been sent just yet


[02/29/2024 19:11] 7a4raf
Keep an eye on the announcement channel, also make sure to import usdc on polygon network

They aren't open unfortunately, but if it helps, the people selected were rank 1, 2 and 4, and you would probably have been placed as an alternate if you did sign up


[03/01/2024 04:59] haxatron1
So it probably wouldnt have mattered anyway


[03/01/2024 04:59] haxatron1
But i agree the backstage requirements for mitigation review are a bit unfair to you


[03/07/2024 12:03] scoolj
is the report out?


[03/08/2024 12:56] _paperparachute
Not yet, it'll be visible on the website when it is 🙂


[03/08/2024 12:57] _paperparachute
There is also a mitigation review, so the original report won't be released until the mitigation review information is added.


[03/09/2024 06:28] scoolj
Okay.  Thank you
